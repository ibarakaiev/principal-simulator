# Principal Simulator
Hello,

Congratulations on your appointment as interim principal of Willips Dexeter Academy! The school is thrilled to work with you over the course of the next year.

You will be presented with a series of important decisions, each of which can affect your annual revenue, expenditures, and — perhaps most importantly — your endowment. Decisions will also affect the satisfaction of students, donors, parents, faculty, and the school's image at large.

Be sure to consider everyone's interests when making decisions. If any group becomes too dissatisfied, the school will suffer!

If the endowment grows by the end of the year (15 rounds), you win! But if it decreases, you lose. And if any group's satisfaction is below 40% (it'll be highlighted in red) at week 15, you'll also lose. But ultimately, all that matters is growing that big ol' endowment (while also making sure no one is too unhappy)!

On behalf of the entire school community, we wish you the best of luck during your tenure here.

Yours sincerely,
The Willips Community
