# principal-simulator
A HackExeter project where you are in charge of a high school.

You are the principal of a high school and everyday you are tasked with making tough decisions. Your decisions will affect the happiness of students, parents, faculty, and donors. They will also affect the image of the school, and the amount of money the school has. You must make decisions that will keep everybody happy. If your decisions make anyone extremely unhappy, run out of money, or destroy the image of your school, it will fall apart. If your school makes it through the whole year without falling apart, you are a successful principal!
